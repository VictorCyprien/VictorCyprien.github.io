> Custom API creation service

## Description

The aim is to create a custom API for your needs!

To do this, I'll be using Python Flask.

The API will then be tested with unit and integration tests using Pytest.

In addition, I'll provide an SDK (Software Development Kit), to facilitate interaction with the front-end.

Finally, the API will be fully Dockerizable for easy deployment.

Please contact me to discuss your project and budget!


## Pricing

The price for the development of a basic API is €300.

Delivery time is 7 days.

## Extras

There are 3 additional options:

- Fast delivery: Delivery time is 4 days instead of 7 days, for an extra 200 €.
- User rights system: The API will be equipped with a user rights system for an extra 25 €.
- Authentication system: The API will be equipped with an authentication system for an extra 25 €. 

## F.A.Q

### What language will you use to develop the API?

I'll use Python as the language and Flask as the framework.

### Can you develop a front-end?

I don't develop front-end applications, but I can provide an SDK to facilitate interaction with the API.

### What else do you offer?

In every offer, the API will be tested with unit and integration tests thanks to Pytest. Finally, the API will be fully Dockerizable for easy production release.

### I've got a special request that's not listed in the extras.

Come and talk about it! The door is always open :)
